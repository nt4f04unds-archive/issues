issue https://github.com/ryanheise/audio_service/issues/653

plugin should check whether everything is fine in config and throw, if not.

i intentionally did not complete any steps mentioned here https://github.com/ryanheise/audio_service/tree/one-isolate/audio_service#android-setup
and it just hags on forever on app start

to clone use

```
git clone -b audio_service_653 --single-branch git@github.com:nt4f04unds-archive/issues.git
```
